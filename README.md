Hello, this website is an online store programmed with Python, Django and JavaScript.

## Summary of features and distinctions:
1. Using Bootstrap 5 (different from other projects)
2. Fully responsive (different from other projects)
3. Optimizing and making changes in the management panel (different from other projects)
4. The possibility of entering and exiting as well as user registration
5. The possibility of editing the user profile, address, etc. by the user (different from other projects)
6. Ability to search for products
7. Ability to view information and order status in the user panel
8. Registration of products only by the admin and from the management panel (different from other projects)
9. Changing the status of orders (confirm/reject or send) by the manager (different from other projects)
10. Personalization of AbstractUser (different from other projects)
## Complexity and distinctiveness:
The difference between this project and my previous projects is that in this project I have changed the Django management panel a lot, which was not in my previous projects. So, in this project, there is no news of that boring Django management panel.

I have used Bootstrap 5 here, which is the latest version of Bootstrap, but I did not use Bootstrap at all in previous programs.

Unlike the previous projects, this project has been responsive, the screen components change according to the screen size of each device.

In this project, each user has a profile that can view their orders and track the status of their orders, and can also edit their information and address. These capabilities are very different and more advanced than previous projects.

Also, in this project, the user field has been personalized, which was not the case in previous projects. These were the differences of my project.
## How does it run?
Like other Python and Django programs, my program is executed with the run server command.
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
## Additional information you should know:
In this project, because we wanted to change the admin panel to our liking, we had to add some files in the admin template folder and we also need to add or change some changes in the settings.py file where you can see the changes.
## Important files:
- The files in the path below change the default management panel.
- * mysite\mysite\templates\admin
- There are fixed files of the management panel in the following path.
- * mysite\mysite\static\admin
- You can see the program files in the path below.
- * mysite\store
- and the application database is located in the root or mysite folder.
## Thank you for taking the time to read this file.
